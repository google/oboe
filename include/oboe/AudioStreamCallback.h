     * For an output stream, this function should render and write numFrames of data
     * in the stream's current data format to the audioData buffer.
     *
     * For an input stream, this function should read and process numFrames of data
     * from the audioData buffer.
     *
     * The audio data is passed through the buffer. So do NOT call read() or
     * write() on the stream that is making the callback.
     *
     * Note that numFrames can vary unless AudioStreamBuilder::setFramesPerCallback()
     * is called. If AudioStreamBuilder::setFramesPerCallback() is NOT called then
     * numFrames should always be <= AudioStream::getFramesPerBurst().
     *
     * Also note that this callback function should be considered a "real-time" function.
     * It must not do anything that could cause an unbounded delay because that can cause the
     * audio to glitch or pop.
     *
     * These are things the function should NOT do:
     * <ul>
     * <li>allocate memory using, for example, malloc() or new</li>
     * <li>any file operations such as opening, closing, reading or writing</li>
     * <li>any network operations such as streaming</li>
     * <li>use any mutexes or other synchronization primitives</li>
     * <li>sleep</li>
     * <li>oboeStream->stop(), pause(), flush() or close()</li>
     * <li>oboeStream->read()</li>
     * <li>oboeStream->write()</li>

     * <li>oboe::convertToText()</li>
     * <li>oboeStream->setBufferSizeInFrames()</li>

     * we recommend the use of non-blocking techniques such as an atomic FIFO.
